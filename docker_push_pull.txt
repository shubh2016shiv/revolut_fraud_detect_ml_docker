### PUSH THE DOCKER ###
After the docker image is built on local, a new repo on docker hub has to be created
Before pushing to the created dockerhub repository, it im IMPORTANT to tag it.

Step 1:
    Login Command: docker login -user <username>
    example: docker login -user shubh2014shivdocker
    <Supply the password>

Step 2:
    Tag the Docker Image: docker tag <image name> <dockerhub repo name>/<image name>:latest

Step 3:
    Push the Image: docker push <dockerhub repo name>/<image name>:latest


Remember:
    DockerHub is synonymous with Elastic Container Registry (ECR) on AWS
    Docker image has to be fist pushed in ECR on aws
    then, it has to be run one of the EC2 instances by pulling from the ECR.

    Along with use of Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Task Definition, a service could be created
    which could be used to deploy the docker container on AWS.
